Purpose 

The final project engages students in developing applications of Computer Vision (CV). It emphasizes bridging theoretical principles with practical system-building for visual perception tasks. 

 

Learning Outcomes (LOs) 

LO 1: Describe various computational principles and standard image processing operators in computer vision 

LO 2: Explain the local features with their detectors and descriptors in computer vision 

LO 3: Employ various features to find the correspondence between images and perform recognition in computer vision 

LO 4: Build various image recognition systems in computer vision

Suggested Themes 

• Image Classification (e.g., digits, medical, plants) 

• Object Detection (e.g., vehicles, faces, anomalies) 

• Image Segmentation (e.g., medical, autonomous driving) 

• Image/Video Analysis (e.g., action recognition, scene understanding) 

• Recognition/Recommendation Systems 

 

Technical Notes 

• Language: Python (preferred) or other suitable 

• Frameworks: Flask, Django, Streamlit for web; Kivy/Flutter for mobile 

• Other frameworks allowed with prior instructor approval 

 

Project Proposal (Checkpoint) 

Submit by Week 6 (1–2 pages): 

• Project title and problem statement 

• Dataset source and description (including licensing/permissions) 

• Initial plan for model/methodology and baseline 

• Planned evaluation metrics and success criteria 

• References (> 2–3 relevant works) 

 

Deliverables & Weights 

• Application (40%) — Functional CV application (e.g., classifier, chatbot, summarizer) with clear inputs/outputs 

• Written Report (40%) — 10–15 pages, academic style; follows required structure; includes analysis and reflection 

• Demo Video (20%) — < 5 minutes; explains problem, workflow, and results with professional narration 

 

Required Report Structure 

• Title Page (Project Title, Team Members, Course Code, Semester) 

• Abstract 

• Introduction (background, problem statement, objectives, significance) 

• Related Work (summary of relevant literature or existing solutions) 

• Methodology (dataset, preprocessing, model architecture, training setup, evaluation metrics) 

• Implementation & Results (system details, experiments, visualizations, results obtained) 

• Discussion & Limitations (analysis of performance, challenges, trade-offs) 

• Conclusion & Future Work 

• References (IEEE/APA format) 

• Appendix (team contribution statement, screenshots, code snippets) 

 

Dataset Policy 

• Use legal and ethically sourced datasets (public/open-source or collected with proper consent) 

• If collecting data: document the collection process and preprocessing steps 

• Ensure dataset size and quality are sufficient for meaningful experimentation 

• Disclose any data limitations (e.g., imbalance, missing values) and mitigation strategies 

 

Ethics & Responsible AI 

• Avoid unfair bias and discrimination in dataset/model design 

• Ensure transparency/explainability of results where feasible 

• Protect privacy and handle sensitive data responsibly 

• Avoid harmful or unethical applications of AI 

 

Team Contribution Statement 

• List specific contributions per member (data, preprocessing, modeling, UI/app, report) 

• Highlight shared tasks and coordination methods (e.g., Git, issue tracker) 

• Include weekly/biweekly contribution logs if requested by instructor
